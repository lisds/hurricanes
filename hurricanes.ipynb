    "\n",
    "Our next step is to investigate some measure of Atlantic storms, to assess the\n",
    "NOAA opinion above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular measure of storm severity is [Acculated Cyclone\n",
    "Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The definitive reference for this measure appears to be [Bell *et al* 2000\n",
    "— \"Climate Assessment for\n",
    "1999\"](https://journals.ametsoc.org/downloadpdf/journals/bams/81/6/1520-0477_2000_81_s1_caf_2_0_co_2.xml).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quoting from that document:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The second measure of over- all seasonal activity is referred to as the\n",
    "hurricane destruction potential (HDP), which is calculated by summing the\n",
    "squares of the estimated 6-hourly maximum sustained wind speed (${V_{max}}^2$)\n",
    "for all periods in which the system is a hurricane. This index represents\n",
    "a single, continuous distribution that implicitly accounts for numbers of\n",
    "hurricanes, yet also gives more weight to strong systems and long-lasting\n",
    "systems. A slight modification of the HDP index involves accumulating\n",
    "${V_{max}}^2$ for all 6-hourly periods in which the system is either a tropical\n",
    "storm or hurricane, thereby also accounting for the number and duration of\n",
    "storms while at a tropical storm status. This modified HDP index is referred to\n",
    "as accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index (Fig. 28), and is both a physically\n",
    "and statistically reasonable measure of overall activity during a given\n",
    "hurricane season.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see from the Wikipedia page above, is also typical to divide the\n",
    "ACE measure by 10,000 to make the numbers easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to recap, the ACE measure for one storm would involve the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the tracking measurements (\"tracks\") corresponding to the storm.\n",
    "* From these, select wind-speed measurements measured at 6 hour intervals.   In\n",
    "  practice these are always measures taken or estimated at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00\n",
    "  and 18:00.  We will discard measures at other times.\n",
    "* From these measures, select those where the status of the storm at the\n",
    "  time qualified it as a storm or a hurricane.  For example, we discard any\n",
    "  tracks (measurements) where, at the time, the storm was classified as\n",
    "  a Tropical Depression or similar.\n",
    "* For the remaining observations, square all the measures of maximum sustained\n",
    "  wind speed, add these up, and divide by 10,000."
